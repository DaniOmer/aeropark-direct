## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[INSERT STRIPE SECRET KEY]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[INSERT STRIPE PUBLISHABLE KEY]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=[INSERT YOUR PRODUCTION URL OR http://localhost:3000 FOR LOCAL]
   ```

   - Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` can be found in your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` should be your production URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com) or http://localhost:3000 for local development

5. Run migrations with following commands:

   ```bash
   npm run db:link supabase_project_id
   npm run db:up
   ```

6. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

7. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

## Feedback and issues

Please file feedback and issues over on the [Supabase GitHub org](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/new/choose).

## Stripe Integration

This project includes Stripe integration for processing payments. The integration is configured to:

1. Create payment intents using the Stripe API
2. Process payments securely on the client side
3. Update reservation status based on payment results
4. Send confirmation emails after successful payments

### Payment Processing Security

The payment system has been designed to ensure that reservations are only confirmed when payments are successfully completed. Any errors during the payment process are properly handled and displayed to the user.

Previously, the system included a development fallback mechanism that could automatically confirm reservations even when payments failed. This fallback has been completely removed to ensure consistent behavior across all environments.

If you encounter issues with payments in production, verify that:

1. Your Stripe API keys are correctly configured in your environment variables
2. The Stripe account is properly set up and active
3. The webhook endpoints are correctly configured
